## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your system
- pip (Python package manager)

### Installation

1. **Clone or download the project**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd flask_app
   ```

2. **Install required dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install flask pytz
   ```

3. **Run the application**

   python app.py
   ```

4. **Access the application**
   
   Open your browser and navigate to:
   ```
   http://127.0.0.1:5000/
   ```
   
   To see personalized output:
   ```
   http://127.0.0.1:5000/showname?name=YourName
   ```

## 💡 Usage Examples

**Example 1:**
```
http://localhost:5000/showname?name=Nitisha
```
**Output:**
- Name displayed: `NITISHA`
- Time-based greeting (e.g., "Good Morning ☀️")
- Random fun fact (e.g., "Your name gives positive vibes ✨")

**Example 2:**
```
http://localhost:5000/showname?name=John
```
**Output:**

- Appropriate greeting based on current IST time
- A randomly selected motivational message

## 🌐 AWS EC2 Deployment

The application was successfully deployed on AWS EC2. Here's a summary of the deployment process:

1. **EC2 Instance Setup**
   - Launched an Amazon Linux EC2 instance
   - Configured security groups to allow HTTP traffic

2. **Installation**
   ```bash
   sudo yum update -y
   sudo yum install python3 -y
   pip3 install flask pytz
   ```

3. **Running on EC2**
   ```bash
   python3 app.py
   ```
   
   For production deployment, modify the last line in `app.py`:
   ```python
   app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=5000)
   ```

4. **Access**
   ```
   http://<EC2-Public-IP>:5000/showname?name=YourName
   ```

**Note:** The EC2 instance was stopped after demonstration to avoid charges.

## 📝 Code Explanation

### Main Route (`/`)
Displays the home page with the input form.

### Show Name Route (`/showname`)
- Retrieves the `name` parameter from the URL
- Validates input (redirects to home if empty)
- Generates a time-based greeting using IST
- Selects a random fun fact from a predefined list
- Renders the template with personalized data

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

- [ ] Fetch name meanings from authoritative APIs
- [ ] Display name popularity and global statistics
- [ ] Add more personalization options (favorite color, hobbies, etc.)
- [ ] Implement a database to store user visits
- [ ] Enhanced UI with animations and modern design
- [ ] Multi-language support
- [ ] Share greeting feature (social media integration)

## 🎯 Learning Outcomes

This project demonstrates:
- Flask routing and request handling
- Template rendering with dynamic data
- Timezone-aware datetime operations
- Random selection and user engagement techniques
- Basic deployment on cloud infrastructure (AWS EC2)
- Clean code structure and project organization
