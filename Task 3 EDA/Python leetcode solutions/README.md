# LeetCode – Python Practice (Optimized Solutions)

This repository contains my Python 3 solutions to selected LeetCode problems, solved as part of practice and skill evaluation.

The focus while solving these problems was:

* writing **clear and readable Python**
* using **built-in libraries and Pythonic constructs** where appropriate
* keeping solutions **time and space efficient**
* avoiding unnecessary complexity or over-engineering

These solutions reflect how I would approach problems in a real interview or assessment setting.


## Problems Covered

1. **1464 – Maximum Product of Two Elements in an Array**
2. **1395 – Count Number of Teams**
3. **1450 – Number of Students Doing Homework at a Given Time**
4. **1342 – Number of Steps to Reduce a Number to Zero**
5. **338 – Counting Bits**

Each problem is implemented independently and follows LeetCode’s expected function signatures.


## Approach & Style

* Python 3.x
* Preference for **built-in functions** and simple logic
* No unnecessary helper classes or abstractions
* Code written to be **easy to read and explain**, not just compact

Time and space complexity considerations were kept in mind for every solution.


## Notes

* These are **practice solutions**, not copied templates.
* Multiple valid approaches exist; the ones used here prioritize clarity and reliability.
* Suitable for learning, revision, and interview preparation.
