# 📊 Data Science Internship Work – IRL

This repository contains my **task-wise submissions and practice work** completed as part of my **Data Science Internship at IRL**.

The goal of this repository is to **document my learning process**, **demonstrate applied concepts**, and **maintain transparency** in how I approach problem-solving, data analysis, and coding tasks during the internship.

---

## 📌 Purpose of This Repository

- Maintain a **structured record** of internship tasks  
- Upload **EDA, Python practice, and problem-solving work**  
- Track **progress and improvements** over time  
- Make my work **reviewable and reproducible**

### Some tasks may include:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Python problem solving (LeetCode-style)
- Data preprocessing and visualization
- Concept-based assignments

---


##Each **task folder** corresponds to a specific internship assignment.  
Subfolders like `eda/` contain notebooks or scripts related to **data analysis and exploration**.

---

## 🧠 Approach & Learning Philosophy

- Code is written with **clarity and readability** in mind  
- Preference for **optimal and maintainable solutions**  
- Focus on **understanding concepts**, not just output  
- Incremental uploads reflect **learning progress**, not just final answers  

Some files may be updated or reorganized as concepts become clearer — this is **intentional** and part of the learning process.

---

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies

- Python 3  
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- GitHub for version control  
- LeetCode-style problem solving for logic building  

---

## 📈 Notes

- This repository is **actively updated**  
- Folder and file names reflect the **task they belong to**  
- Any restructuring is done to **improve clarity and correctness**
